# Data Science for Psychologists
## Course Materials

This repository contains the course materials for [Data Science for Psychologists](http://glennwilliams.me/ds-psych/).

Exercises are organised by each chapter and contain the Quarto documents and rendered HTML files for the slides and exercises for each workshop. 

This repository will be updated weekly with the content ahead of the workshop sessions.

To engage in workshops, either clone this repository to your computer or manually download it by clicking Code, and Download ZIP. Unzip the files to complete the exercises and view slides.

I will release answers to the exercises each week via Microsoft Teams.

If you download the materials manually then ensure you keep backups for any edited documents.
